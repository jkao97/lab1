1. I ssh'ed from my personal computer onto the unix server. 
2. I read the intro(1) page of the manual. I learned some new things like what Linux was in relation to Unix (I couldn't really distinguish before) and some new  commands.
3. I chose vim because I am more familiar to it compared to emacs. I used vim when I took CPE 202 in Spring Quarter(2017). 
4. I did not encounter any problems while writing my code.
